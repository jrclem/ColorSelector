# ColorSelector
This is a quick build with Arduino to play with some Adafruit NeoPixels.

It uses a potentiometer to determine the Red, Green and Blue values of the LEDs so you can pick a color from the spectrum that you like. It uses the Serial connection in the USB to send the selected RGB values to your computer's screen so you can save them for later use.

The overview of this project can be seen in [this video](http://bit.ly/2dqAwrm) and the code walkthrough can be seen [here](http://bit.ly/2dr1Iuk).

###Parts:
* 4x push buttons
* 1x Potentiometer
* 1x [Arduino Neopixel](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1260)
* [Arduino Neopixel Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel)

###Assembly:
Connect the components acording to the [schematics provided](../master/Schematics.png).

###Operation:
1. Connecto your Arduino device to your computer
2. Move the position of the potentiometer to determine a value between 0 and 255.
3. Click on the corresponding RGB button to assigne the value
4. Click on the print button to send the RGB values to the computer screen.
