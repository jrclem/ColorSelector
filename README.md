This is a quick build with Arduino to play with some Adafruit NeoPixels.

Parts:
4x push buttons
1x Potentiometer
1x Arduino Neopixel

Assembly:
Connect the components acording to the seketch provided in the file.

Operation:
1. Connecto your Arduino device to your computer
2. Move the position of the potentiometer to determine a value between 0 and 255.
